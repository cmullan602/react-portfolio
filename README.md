## Description

This is my portfolio created using react and deployed using github pages. I used MUI for CSS framework. You can view my latest projects find contact info and my most recent resume. This webstie was designed mobile forward and meant to function best on a mobile device. I have enjoyed how much easier it is to work with React.
